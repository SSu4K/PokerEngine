A Texas Hold'em Poker enigine. Intended for future use in online poker game. Utilizes the pokerkit package.
The code enables running a full poker game and retrieving the ***gamestate*** at each step of the game. The gamestate is a clearly labeled ***json*** serializable object.

### Requirements:
- Python 3.11 or higher
- [PokerKit library](https://pypi.org/project/pokerkit/0.0.2/)

### Example use:
```python
from engine import *

config = PokerConfig(500, 1000, 2000, 3)
players = [Player("Ricky", 10000), Player("Julian", 10000), Player("John", 10000)]

engine = PokerEngine(config)

for player in players:
    engine.add_player(player)

engine.reset()
engine.game_step()

while(engine.running):
    if(engine.game_phase != GamePhase.WAITING_MOVE):
        engine.game_step()
    else:
        print(engine.get_game_state())
        print("Input move:")
        name = input()
        value = None
        if(name == MoveType.BET.value or name == MoveType.RAISE.value):
            print("Input value:")
            value = int(input())

        move = Move(MoveType(name), value)
        print(vars(move))
        engine.game_step(move)

    print(engine.get_game_state())
```
